The EM (Expectionation-Maximization) Algorithm is a general optimization method that is often applied to find the maximum likelihood estimates when missing values are present in a data set. The algorithm arose from the seminal paper, \textit{Maximum Likelihood for incomplete data via the EM algorithm} by Dempster, Laird, and Rubin, and has since been widely applied and extended to other types of statistical problems. In particular, the algorithm is known to be applicable in a range of Bayesian estimation problems. \\
